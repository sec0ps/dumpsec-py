DumpSec-Py

DumpSec-Py is a modern Python-based clone of the classic Windows DumpSec utility, used by security professionals and system administrators to audit system permissions and configurations.

This tool provides full visibility into local Windows system security settings, group memberships, services, scheduled tasks, file share permissions, registry permissions, local security policies, and domain trust information — all in one place, written entirely in Python.
